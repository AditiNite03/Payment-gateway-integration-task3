        <h1>What we do!</h1>
        <h2>SpreadSmileFoundation</h2>
        <p>The second wave of COVID – 19 has been devastating on lives and livelihoods, and as of June 18, 2021, India
          continues to have more than 600,000 cases reported in a day.This foundation works with children in the belief that every young
           person can develop to their maximum potential with the love, attention and proper support of all who care for them.
            Our key principle is collaboration - we can do our work only because children have families, teachers and communities.
             Hand in hand with them we strive to achieve the best for every child.Our focus is on the developmental and behavioural
              wellbeing of children from birth to 19 years. A multidisciplinary team of professionals cares for children referred for
               assessment and therapy services. The child and the family are at the centre of our work. Therefore utmost importance is 
               given to ensuring that families feel empowered to support their children. Our work with children can be in individual
                or group settings. Parents are encouraged to sit in on therapy sessions and are given 'homework' - to practice the
                 teaching strategies that they have learnt, in the child's natural environment.<br><br>
